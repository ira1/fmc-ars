<p class="">The survey asked musicians about their recording credits, composing credits, and number of shows performed. Respondents could respond with a range of "0" to "more than 100" for each question. The overall survey data results suggested that anyone who answered more than 50 was a statistically significant achievement, and so this table shows the <% if FilterProfileName()=='All Musicians' %>musicians<% elsif FilterProfileName()=='Other musicians' %><strong class="">all-other-genres musicians</strong> <%else%><strong class=""><%= FilterProfileName().downcase %></strong><%end%> who reached this threshold. </p><table>
